# Tech-blog
The Modivation for this project was to show the connectivity of the handlebars. What I have learned with in this project was usefulness of sequelize and handlebars in creating different pages throughout this project. Doing this show me all it takes to create a interactive website. Some problems I did face during this project was insuring all the routes connected to each other. This was fixed by taking time to look over my code to ensure that it was properly labled and configured.
